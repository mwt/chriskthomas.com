<p>It&#8217;s official, I&#8217;m writing a book, but I can still get writer&#8217;s block from a blog post.</p>



<p>As a first time author, even 35,000 words in, it&#8217;s still a weird feeling being committed to writing something without any clue what works. They say not to turn to an agent or a publisher until you&#8217;ve finished your draft, which means that you have to find your way to the end of a millions winding paths just to get directions that you were supposed to be going the other way.</p>



<p>Thankfully, I’ve had access to plenty of people willing to read what I have so far. I always thought that dedicated sections at the start of books were just for the most important people in the author’s life—a spouse, a dead relative, a really cute dog—but with all the incredible feedback I’ve been getting, it feels like I should dedicate my book to my army of amateur editors. I’ll have to credit it to friends, coworkers, everyone from my college, strangers I met online—by the time it’s finished, half of my book is probably going to have to be the dedicated section.</p>



<p>So really, what I’m trying to say is that a <em>lot</em> of people have read my book.</p>



<p>On to the nitty gritty: It&#8217;s a YA fantasy novel—working title: <em>The Extra Children</em>—and it&#8217;s going to be the first in a series of at least three books. It feels like most authors find their inspirations in other literature, but my writing draws more on visual arts, from games to comics and shows.</p>



<p>I’ll reveal a lot more about the specifics as time goes on, but for now, I&#8217;m planning on using this blog to document my experiences with writing and attempting to publish for the very first time.</p>



<p>Thank you for your support.</p>
